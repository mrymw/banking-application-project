# Banking with Java Project 
This project is a comprehensive Java Banking Application designed with a command line interface (CLI). It showcases object-oriented principles through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes. It also leverages JUnit for thorough testing. The application integrates a txt file database to manage information about bankers and customers, with specific functionalities for bankers to add customers and for all users to perform standard banking operations such as withdrawals, deposits, and money transfers.

# Technologies Used
- StringJoiner
- AES Algorithm for Encryption and Decryption of Passwords (youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8LeYbztZxo&list=PLtgomJ95NvbPDMQClkBZPijLdEFyo0VHa&index=2)
- Abstract Class (User Details Class)
- Interface (Bank)
- Enum (Type Of Cards)

# Favorite Functions
- Transfer Function :
  I like how the functionality actually works from transferring fron one user to another in such a simple way. 

# Notes
- The database.txt file stores password in encrypted manner, hence I have created actualUserPassword.txt which includes the userID with their actual passwords.
